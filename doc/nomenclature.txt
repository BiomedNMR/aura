OpenCL has command queues, CUDA has streams

I need a new word that encompasses both
The word should generalize on execution path (German: Ausfuehrungspfad),
or execution environment or execution envelope or something like this.
The word must be the name of the template argument for all library functions
that require an execution environment. Some options:

* fiber: this would be kind of a new concept but maybe it makes sense, since
it is not a thread but a concurrent environment
* execution path: to long
* task queue
* spark: a concept from haskell 
* transaction
