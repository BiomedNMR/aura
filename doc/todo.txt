Tests run on device 0 most of the time, for OpenCL this is often
the CPU, so we're not really testing the device. Maybe we should
be able to define on which device ordinal to run tests.

Missing parameters for functions:
Plenty backend parameters are not exposed at the moment



Done:

The kernel calling mechanism should be sanitized, probably with runtime
argument sizes instead of compile time. This reduces the number of functions
we have and the number of error messages we generate in case of an error
and is a lot simpler to maintain and a lot more flexible too.
