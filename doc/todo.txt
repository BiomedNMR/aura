There is something weird when putting devices and feeds in vectors
without reserving space beforehand. The move thing does not seem
to work!

Tests run on device 0 most of the time, for OpenCL this is often
the CPU, so we're not really testing the device. Maybe we should
be able to define on which device ordinal to run tests.

Missing parameters for functions:
Plenty backend parameters are not exposed at the moment

Maybe remove the empty_ flag and replace by nullptr to device, per convention
if a device resource has a nullptr as device it is neither initialized 
nor usable.

All types that can be empty should have the bool operator to evaluate to
false if they are empty.


Done:
The kernel calling mechanism should be sanitized, probably with runtime
argument sizes instead of compile time. This reduces the number of functions
we have and the number of error messages we generate in case of an error
and is a lot simpler to maintain and a lot more flexible too.
