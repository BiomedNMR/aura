Maybe remove th empty_ flag and replace by nullptr to device, per convention
if a device resource has a nullptr as device it is neither initialized 
nor usable.

All types that can be empty should have the bool operator to evaluate to
false if they are empty.

Missing parameters for functions - many!

Done:
The kernel calling mechanism should be sanitized, probably with runtime
argument sizes instead of compile time. This reduces the number of functions
we have and the number of error messages we generate in case of an error
and is a lot simpler to maintain and a lot more flexible too.
