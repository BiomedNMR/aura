cuda:

1) device is created from id (or whatever)
2) context is created from device (context is associated with calling thread 
right away)
3) after that, cuda commands can be launched 
4) streams seem to specific to contexts (check this), so a stream should be 
created from a device/context

streams and events are per device

Devices, Streams, and Events
* CUDA streams and events are per device 
    Determined by the GPU thatâ€™s current at the time of their creation
    Each device has its own default stream (aka 0- or NULL-stream)
* Using streams and events 
    Calls to a stream can be issued only when its device is current
    Event can be recorded only to a stream of the same device

For peer 2 peer communication, which context needs to be specified (source or
destination)?

Popping the context every time ca be a bad idea when doing low level
programming. A tool should be provided to make a feed permanent.
