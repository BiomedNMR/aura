Events
======

CUDA apparently can synchronize streams between each other through events.
cuStreamWaitEvent can eneque a wait in one stream that waits for an event
in another stream. This is really really good in terms of having streams
as general concurrency concepts. OpenCL seems to be lacking this feature
and I really don't know why. Or maybe I have not found it yet or don't
understand some of the OpenCL documentation. Too bad.

Should an event be called

event
marker
label
incident
signal
sensor

probably event is the best, signal is also good
