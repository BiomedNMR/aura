Device and Feed

Having proper device and feed semantics is imporant. There are subtile problems
if the context is not set and external libraries are used because the 
implicitly expect a context (like CUFFT).

Should memory be a tuple of pointer and context? In an upper layer definitely,
maybe not in the lowest layer.

Setting context should only be allowed by the device which owns the context.
This context can be pinned, if a feed wants to set/unset a context it has to
go through the device which knows if a context was pinned.
