Vector
======

What should a device vector be called?

dev_vector
device_vector
device_vec

Probably device_vector will be nice. 
The smart pointers library for example has shared_ptr and shared_array,
the standard now has shared_ptr, weak_ptr etc. This would favour 
device_vec but I still prefer device_vector.

Market research:

boost compute has
boost::compute::vector<T, allocator>

vexvl has
vexcl::vector

mtl4 has 
mtl::vector::dense_vector
that inherits from
::mtl::detail::contiguous_memory_block

paralution has
LocalVector<T>
that is used on a device after MoveToAccelerator is called.

Thrust has
thrust::device_vector
