Bench
=====

List of required/desired benchmarks:

* (backend) empty kernel with different number of 
  parameters; test with different mesh and bundle sizes

* (computation) kernel doing many MAD ops to try to get
  max peak GFLOP performance

* (bandwidth) kernel accessing device memory to 
  determine max throughput
  
* (bandwidth) kernel accessing shared memory to 
  determine max throughput

* (mri-domain) 2D and 3D FFT transforms

* (mri-domain) kernels taken from Martin's reco kit

* (mri-domain) BLAS operations relevant for MRI
