FFTBench
========

God, I hope this is the last FFT benchmark code I will ever write.

We want to specify:
* runtime per single test in seconds
* types: fwd, bwd, in-place, out-of-place
* size as a range, i.e. 3D: 200:+1:300,200:+2:300,50
* batch size as a range
* list of device ordinals the test should run on
* consecutive or parallel execution in case of multiple devices

Is this overkill? Might be...
I can use the range thing for all benchmarks though.
