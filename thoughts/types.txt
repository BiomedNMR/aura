Types
=====

The CUFFT and the clFFT library define size types differently.
CUFFT uses int, clFFT uses size_t. Those types might not be
compatible.

We probably have to define a specific size type for this case
that is typedefed differently for each library. Uses then have
to cast their whatever-types probably explicitly to the specific
size type.
