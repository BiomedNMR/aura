Pinned Memory
=============

This seems to be very confusing in OpenCL.
My interpretation so far:

create pinned host memory with either:
CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR or CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR
this gives OpenCL buffer that somehow must be usable
as regular block of memory, have to test how and if this is true

copying stuff from a buffer allocated with these parameters
should make it possible to use pinned memory
