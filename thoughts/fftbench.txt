FFTBench
========

God, I hope this is the last FFT benchmark code I will ever write.

We want to specify:
* runtime per single test in seconds
* types: fwd, bwd, in-place, out-of-place
* size as a range, i.e. 3D: 200:+1:300,200:+2:300,50
* batch size as a range
* list of device ordinals the test should run on
* consecutive or parallel execution in case of multiple devices

Is this overkill? Might be.
I can use the range thing for all benchmarks though.

The range handling can be some generic thing, what should it be called?

range_handler
range_parser
range_generator
range_gen
extent_generator
extent_handler
extent_gen
sequence_generator
nsequence_generator
sequence

sequence_generator makes sense but is rather bulky,
let's try sequence and see if it works.
